      <h1>Campus Safety</h1>
      <p>
        At the University of Florida, student safety is a top priority. By staying aware, using campus resources, and taking a few basic precautions,
        you can help ensure a safe experience for yourself and others.
      </p>

      <div className="campus-box">
        <h2>Walking on Campus</h2>
        <p>Stay aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Stick to well-lit walkways and avoid secluded areas. Walk with friends when possible, and always trust your instincts. If something feels off, don’t ignore it. You can request a ride from the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol (SNAP) for safe transportation after dark.</p>
