      <h2>Stay Informed</h2>
      <p>Always monitor GatorSafe, UF Alerts, or the National Weather Service for real-time updates. Pay attention to instructions from campus safety officials, and have a plan in place with your roommates or friends in case youâ€™re separated during an emergency.</p>

      <p>Preparedness is key. Take a few minutes to review emergency routes in your dorm or apartment and make sure you know how to get emergency alerts from UF.</p>
