      <h1>üî• Wildfire Safety (Less Common but Possible)</h1>
      <p>
        While wildfires are rare in Florida, nearby states or regional wind patterns can result in poor air quality due to drifting smoke.
        It‚Äôs important to understand how to protect your health and safety when smoke is in the area.
      </p>

      <div className="wildfire-box">
        <h2>üìã Before Smoke Exposure</h2>
        <p>Monitor local news and air quality indexes through websites like <a href="https://www.airnow.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AirNow.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>If you have respiratory conditions such as asthma or allergies, make sure medications are up-to-date and easily accessible.</p>
        <p>Check that your indoor air filters are clean and functioning. Consider using HEPA air purifiers in common areas.</p>
        <p>Keep a supply of N95 or KN95 masks on hand in case you need to go outside during heavy smoke events.</p>

        <p>Use air purifiers or portable fans with filters to improve indoor air quality.</p>
